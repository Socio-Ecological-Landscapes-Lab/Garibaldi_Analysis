This repository was used in Jan/Feb 2025 by Liz McCleary and Noemie Boulanger-Lapointe to compile, clean and analyze the point frame data that was collected using ITEX protocol in the summers of 2022 and 2024 in Sentinel and Sphinx Bay on Garibaldi Lake in Garibaldi Provincial Park. The original 2022 point frame data can be found in the ITEX/Garibaldi GitHub as well as cleaning scripts similar to the one used in this analysis. Note that in the process of cleaning the 2022/2024 data, plots were reordered to restore numerical order and that all heights were multiplied by 10 in the 2022 data. Additionally, certain species names were corrected after being misidentified in 2022 and 2024 during surveying. These correction were reviewed by Dr. Ken Marr of the Royal BC Museum. 

Analysis required the merging of the functional groups dataset (Species_Func_Groups.xlsx) to the 2022/2024 data(merged_data_2022, merged_data_2024). All cleaning and compiling was done in one R file (clean_compile.R). These two datasets were manually merged into one file (ITEX_merged_2025.xlsx) which was analyzed using the R script stat_ITEX2024.R.
